# CS_260_hw1

One .py file exists for logistic regression (hw1_log_reg.py) and another exists for SVM (hw1_SVM.py). Either can be run in PyCharm, or in a terminal using "python hw1_log_reg.py" and "python hw1_SVM.py). The programs can be run as-is, or after tuning some or all of the following hyperparameters:

num_epochs is the number of epochs

learn_rate is the step size for SGD

momentum is the momentum magnitude for SGD_Momentum
